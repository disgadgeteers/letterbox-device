# The Leafleteer

### Disability assitive and general protective postal-delivery gadget. 

**NOTE: These are preliminary designs and not yet ready for 3D printing.**

A one-handed solution for delivering leaflets through domestic letterboxes. 

• **Eases** letterbox  deliveries.

• **Reduces** leaflet damage.

• **Protects** operators' hands from potential dog bites and vicious letterboxes.
      
The simple act of delivering / posting a leaflet into residential domestic letterboxes is extremely difficult for anyone with one hand (such as those  with  a limb paralysis arising through stroke or those with a broken arm etc.).
  
Able-bodied users will approach the letterbox and using one hand will open  (often stiff resistive) letterbox flap, leaving open whilst their remaining hand inserts the leaflet. When (if)  the  leaflet / pamphlet is single sheet paper with no rigidity it flexes and will not penetrate the draft-excluding  brushes within: often destroying or compromising the leaflet / post or   preventing fiull letterbox delivery. 

The Leafleteer is a simple 3D box structure designed by John Hunt and Lee Corbin. It inserts with its own rigidity though the letterbox aperture resisting and penetrating  sprung hinged flaps and draught-excluders,       maintaining an open flap and serving as a paper insertion-transmission-conduit that projects the leaflet fall beyond the internal lip of the letterbox.
